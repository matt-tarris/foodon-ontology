# FoodOn-Grounded Ingredient Avoidance Graph

Type an ingredient (`paprika`, `edamame`) or a class (`nightshade`, `allium`, `gluten`)
and see everything that should be treated as containing it — with the path that
justifies each one.

```bash
python3 serve.py            # http://localhost:8790
```

**Find in graph** (the magnifier, or `/`, or ctrl/cmd-F) searches every class in the
current result, not just the ones on screen — labels and synonyms both, since terms
like `spelt` and `semolina` exist only as synonyms. Choosing a hit expands the path
down to it and pans there, so a match collapsed four levels deep is one click away.

A **JSON drawer** slides out from the right edge (the tab marked `JSON`), collapsed by
default. It shows the graph as **one document**: every node and edge carries a
`legend` key naming its category — `query root`, `derives from`, `override` and the
rest — and records are ordered by that category, so the legend groups read as
contiguous blocks without the graph being split apart. A key above the JSON lists the
categories with the legend's own swatches and counts.

`compact` (the default) identifies classes by curie and puts both endpoint labels on
each edge, so an edge reads without cross-referencing; `full` restores IRIs,
definitions and synonyms. Compact keeps every node and every edge — it drops repeated
identifiers and prose, not records. Rendering is capped at 400k characters, which only
the largest closures reach; the copy buttons always emit the complete document.

Nothing calls an LLM at query time. Semantic judgements were made once, offline, and
frozen into reviewable files.

## Reading the graph

**Layout is a radial dendrogram, not a force simulation.** Measured: 83% of the
nightshade closure and 89% of corn have in-degree 1, so a closure is a tree with a few
extra edges — and a force layout is the wrong instrument for that. `forceRadial` pinned
each node to a ring by depth but nothing ordered them *within* the ring, so siblings
from different parents interleaved and their edges crossed back and forth. `d3.cluster`
places every node deterministically: no node overlap and no crossings among tree edges,
guaranteed by the layout rather than negotiated by forces, and identical on every
reload. The remaining ~15% of edges — a term with a second parent — are drawn as curves
bowed through the centre, so nothing is hidden; they are the only lines that can cross,
and they are the ones worth looking at.

**Every leaf sits on the outer ring.** The leaves are the answer to the query — the
things you must not serve — and on the rim they all sit at the maximum radius, where the
circumference is greatest and each one gets the same generous slice of arc. Under
`d3.tree` a leaf sat at its own depth, so a shallow leaf landed on a small ring holding
almost no arc; that is where the crowding was worst. Switching to the dendrogram took
nightshade from 45 labels to **115, with zero collisions**.

The cost, stated plainly: **radius no longer means hops-from-the-root.** In a dendrogram
an internal node's radius is its distance to the deepest leaf beneath it, so a grouping
class with a shallow subtree sits further out than one with a deep subtree. Hop count
moved to the tooltip and the breadcrumb, which report it exactly rather than by eye.

Angular space is allocated per *leaf*, not per subtree, so a wedge is as wide as what is
actually in it. `size([2π, R])` splits the circle evenly between the root's children,
which gave nightshade's 17-term `solanaceae plant` the same half of the canvas as its
130-term `Solanaceae`.

The drawing is sized to its content — arc per leaf, and a ring gap measured from the
labels this query actually has — and never to the pane. That gap used to be a flat 62px
whose own comment said it existed "so the rings stay far enough apart for an internal
node's label to run outward without immediately meeting the next one". It never did
that: on a citrus query the rings land 62px apart and the median label is 93px, so a
typical name ran a ring and a half outward, straight across the nodes sitting there —
`Citrus limonia` printed over its neighbour. The floor is now the **45th percentile of
the query's own label lengths** (capped at 180px, or one query of EFSA code-list names
would set a gap nothing could read). Measured on citrus expanded to 149 nodes:

| ring gap | radius | labels shown | crossings |
|---|---|---|---|
| 62px, flat | 248 | 73 | many |
| 124px, measured | 494 | 133 | 0 |

More labels *and* none of them overlapping, because wider rings let the planner admit
candidates it used to have to drop.

**Each ring gets the gap its own labels need, not a shared one.** A uniform gap makes an
empty ring cost exactly as much radius as a full one, and in a dendrogram the inner rings
are nearly always the empty ones: every leaf is pushed to the rim, so what is left inside
is the skeleton. Measured on `pepper` — 122 drawn nodes in rings of 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 7, 25,
79. **The six innermost rings held 18 nodes between them and took 973px of radius**, which
is the hole in the middle of that drawing. A ring carrying two labels or fewer has the
angle to itself and cannot realistically be blocked, so it gets the 62px minimum; a
crowded ring keeps its full allowance.

| query | radius before | radius after | on-screen scale | labels | crossings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pepper` | 1297 | **802** | 0.25 → **0.37** | 108/122 | 0 |
| `citrus` | 494 | **401** | 0.55 → **0.64** | 124/149 | 0 |

None of this is what keeps labels off nodes — the clearance test does that, at any
spacing. Ring gaps only decide how many labels survive, so compressing an empty ring
costs nothing and buys back the radius. Sizing it to the pane made a 2-node `paprika` query fill the canvas
with two nodes 660px apart and their labels turned vertical. At four leaves or fewer the
labels are counter-rotated back to horizontal, because the radial form buys nothing at
that size.

**Labels are placed by geometry, not by a budget.** A label must clear every other
label *and every node* — the planner only ever compared labels with labels, so a name
could be drawn straight through a circle on the next ring out and nothing objected.
Wider rings fix the typical case by geometry; the node test catches the tail that is
longer than the gap, and drops it rather than printing over a node. Candidates are
considered in priority order — roots, clusters and collapsed parents first, then grouping classes,
organisms, multi-path nodes, leaves — and one is admitted only if it clears every label
already placed, testing arc distance and radial run length. Tier order is what makes it
behave: when a ray is contested the more useful name wins it. That matters because
single-child chains collapse onto one ray (`d3.tree` centres a parent over its
children — corn puts 89 nodes on 72 distinct angles), which is a radial collision no
amount of extra circumference fixes. `always show labels` overrides the whole pass.

**A collapsed cluster is named by culinary function, or by nothing at all.** Where
FoodOn supplies a US CFR rollup, the cluster gets a readable category —
`Bakery & Grain Products · 20`, `Thickeners, Stabilizers & Gelling Agents · 9`. That
path works, and `config/function-categories.json` maps all 170 CFR groups FoodOn uses
onto 19 categories with none left over.

But only **2,342 of 39,894 classes** carry a `member of` rollup at all, so across 16
allergen queries 93 of 136 clusters had no category. Those used to read `via is a` or
`via derives from`, which claimed a grouping rationale the data cannot support: every
child in a taxonomy is reached by `is a`, so the label only repeated what the edge
colour already drew. They now read **`16 more`** — the count is the one fact about
such a group that is certainly true, and it is what you act on. The relation stays on
the edge colour and in the tooltip (`reached by derives from`).

Measured before removing it, on the 135 affected clusters: a shared label stem that
adds anything beyond the parent's own name exists for **8%**. Another 27% have a stem
that merely echoes the parent — `potato` under `potato (whole or pieces)`, `pepper
plant` under `hot pepper plant` — which is no better than `via is a`, and 64% have no
stem at all. Role homogeneity was no better: 62% of clusters are role-pure, but the
labels that yields read as `18 derivatives`. FoodOn names children by extending the
parent's name, which is exactly what makes a shared stem redundant here.

Grouping is still by relation even when unlabelled, so two count-only clusters can
hang off one parent with different edge colours. Merging them would force one colour
onto a mixed group and misreport how the members were reached.

One signal per visual channel, and none of them doubles up:

| channel | encodes |
|---|---|
| **fill** | what kind of thing — near-black query root, brass organism/taxon, sage derivative |
| **unfilled dashed ring** | a FoodOn grouping class (`field corn sweetener product`) — scaffolding, not something you can be served |
| **node size + type size** | role rank, on one ladder: root 15 · organism 10 · category 9 · multi-path 8 · leaf 6.5 |
| **stroke ring** | reached by several paths; a dashed outer ring means reached from more than one query root |
| **edge colour + dash** | the relation, and whether the hop is `ontology`, `repair`, `mined` or `override` |

**Hover anything to see why it is there.** The chain back to the query root is dimmed in
and printed along the bottom with the relation named at every hop, provenance included —
which is how paprika answers for itself:

```
… —is a→ hungarian wax pepper plant —derives from (repair)→ hungarian wax pepper food
product —is a→ paprika (ground)          5 hops from the root
```

That `(repair)` is the point: FoodOn omits the axiom, `build/repair_derives.py` supplies
it, and the breadcrumb says so rather than passing it off as the ontology's own claim.
Clicking keeps the chain up; each crumb is clickable to walk back.

The whole drawing is scaled to fit the pane once, measured from the rendered bounding
box so labels are included rather than clipped; `Reset view` returns to that fit. The
measurement happens on an animation frame, not inline — inline, `getBBox` reported a
613px height for a box that settled at 843, and the gluten query was scaled to 1.27x
instead of 0.93x and clipped on both sides.

## Import & patch layer — using this outside the app

The relationships this project establishes are exportable as a standards-compliant
OWL patch layer, so a team can take a fresh vendor `foodon.owl`, apply one file, and
query the same closures over SPARQL with none of this codebase in the loop.

```bash
./tools/apply_patches.sh          # vendor + patches -> merged -> queryable
```

`ontology/foodon.owl` is never modified. Drop in a new upstream release, re-run, and
the patch layer re-applies unchanged; `ontology/foodon.owl.sha256` pins the release
the patches were reviewed against and the script warns when it differs.

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `ontology/foodon.owl` | vendor, untouched, gitignored |
| `ontology/foodon-local-patches.ttl` | **the patch layer** — generated, reviewed, committed |
| `ontology/catalog-v001.xml` | resolves the `owl:imports` to the local vendor copy, offline |
| `ontology/foodon-merged.owl` | the two as one ontology, for a reasoner or an upload |
| `ontology/foodon-avoidance.ttl` | materialised one-hop relations (derived) |
| `ontology/foodon-queryable.owl` | what `build/sparql/patch_*.rq` runs against |

**The patch file is generated, and that is the point.** `build/emit_patches.py`
reads the governed decision files, so the guards, the claim types and the sign-off
records stay the review surface and the tests keep running against them. It is
written to be *read*: every axiom carries a comment block naming the rule, the
guards, the evidence and the reviewer, and the same facts again as a machine-readable
`local:Patch` record so the audit can be done in SPARQL. `test/patch_run.py` asserts
the round trip both ways — a hand-edit to the generated file, or a decision that
fails to export, breaks the build.

**Only `contains` is emitted as `RO:0001000`.** Four claim types are not
containment and get their own declared object properties, each with an
`rdfs:comment` saying so plainly: `local:mayDeriveFrom` (feedstock is a producer
choice), `local:sharesCompoundWith` (the same molecule reached another way),
`local:crossReactiveWith` (the allergen protein is *not* present),
`local:disputedAvoidance`. Emitting these as `derives from` would tell a
corn-avoider that citric acid contains corn.

**One thing OWL cannot do.** An import is monotonic — it adds and never retracts. So
`peanut plant is_a nut producing plant`, which is defensible botanically and wrong
for allergens, cannot be removed by a patch. It is stated declaratively as
`local:notAvoidanceRelevantFor` for a consumer to honour, rather than pretending the
upstream axiom is gone.

**Patch at the most specific true source.** The tempting axiom for the motivating
case is `hungarian wax pepper food product derives from Solanaceae`. That is wrong:
Solanaceae is family rank with a 631-class closure, while the cultivar plant has 9.
The patch names the cultivar, and Solanaceae is reached through FoodOn's own `is_a`
chain — which keeps the axiom correct for a narrower `Capsicum annuum` query too.
This is the same rule `classify_repairs.py` applies when it declines
`avian food product → avian animal` as class-rank.

### SPARQL, and why it needs two relations

```bash
java -jar tools/robot.jar query --input ontology/foodon-merged.owl      --query build/sparql/patch_validate_paprika.rq /dev/stdout
```

```
paprika (ground) | hungarian wax pepper food product | RO:0001000 |
hungarian wax pepper plant | Solanaceae | local:patch-9a1936568ec0
```

That last column is the audit trail: the bridging hop is identified as one this
layer supplied, not FoodOn's own.

Every IRI in the side panel is a link to the OBO PURL resolver, and they all share
one **named** companion tab, so a session of looking terms up leaves you two tabs to
switch between rather than one per term. `target="_blank"` was wrong for this twice:
it spawns a tab per click, and an embedded webview ignored it and navigated the app's
own tab away, losing the query. The trade-off, recorded in the code: `rel="noopener"`
is deliberately absent, because noopener and name reuse are mutually exclusive — the
destination is the OBO Foundry resolver and this is a localhost tool, so the opener
reference is accepted. Revisit if it is ever served publicly.

SPARQL 1.1 property paths cannot step through a blank-node `owl:Restriction`, so
"subClassOf plus propagating properties" has no single-path form. The one-hop
relation is materialised first and a `+` path closes over it, and it takes **two**
relations rather than one:

- `local:propagatesTo` — derivative propagation, always source → product, so a
  closure over it can never ascend to a shared ancestor and come back down
- `local:pivotsTo` — the rank-guarded forward `in taxon` hop to a species-rank taxon

They are separate because the pivot belongs to the *taxonomic* phase: it fires from
a class reached by `is_a` descent from the root, never from a derivative. Folding
them together is wrong in both directions — measured, omitting the pivot loses
`Brassica juncea` and `brown mustard plant` from a mustard query, and applying it
everywhere pivots `Nirvana corn kernel` up to the species `Zea mays` and gains three
cultivars the app does not reach. `patch_closure.rq` composes them as two phases.

Which properties propagate is **read from the patch layer**, not hardcoded in the
query: `emit_patches.py` writes `local:propagatesAvoidance "inverse"` from
`config/relation_policy.json`, so the policy has one source of truth.

**Verified parity.** `test/patch_run.py` runs the SPARQL closure and the application
traversal over the same roots and requires them to agree exactly:

| root | app | SPARQL | diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solanaceae | 630 | 630 | 0 |
| Maize plant | 188 | 188 | 0 |
| wheat plant | 744 | 744 | 0 |
| sesame plant | 18 | 18 | 0 |
| mustard plant | 25 | 25 | 0 |
| Capsicum | 176 | 176 | 0 |

### Retiring a patch upstream has fixed

```bash
java -jar tools/robot.jar query --input ontology/foodon.owl      --query build/sparql/patch_native_axioms.rq data/native-axioms.csv
python3 build/check_upstream_fixes.py
```

The comparison is against the **vendor file alone**, because the patch layer is
additive and leaves no seam: once merged, our axiom is indistinguishable from
FoodOn's. Currently 93 of 93 patches are still doing work. Nothing is deleted
automatically — retiring goes through the same sign-off, using the `superseded`
status, so the record of why the gap existed survives the fix and
`test/override_run.py` keeps asserting the target is still reached.

A triplestore keeps the vendor graph separate and so can do this in one query;
`build/sparql/named_graphs.ru` has the ingest, the base-graph-only replacement and
that check for a SPARQL 1.1 Update endpoint. It is optional — the ROBOT merge needs
no infrastructure.

## Reclaiming disk

About 160 MB of what sits in `data/` and `ontology/` is derived and rebuildable. All
of it is already gitignored, so this is a local-disk question only.

```bash
./tools/clean.sh                 # dry run: what would go, and the rebuild cost
./tools/clean.sh --sparql --yes  # ~85 MB, 19s to rebuild
./tools/clean.sh --build  --yes  # ~73 MB, 12s to rebuild
./tools/clean.sh --all    --yes  # both
```

Dry run by default; nothing is deleted without `--yes`.

The app opens exactly seven files at startup — `data/index.json` plus
`repairs-classified.json`, `mined-classified.json`, `resolution-store.json` and three
configs. Everything else is either a vendor download or an intermediate. `--build`
does remove `index.json`, so the app will not start again until
`build/build_index.py` has re-run; `--sparql` touches nothing the app reads, and
costs only the parity half of `test/patch_run.py`, which degrades to 6 assertions
with a message rather than failing.

Two guards, and the second is the one that matters:

- the vendor files (`ontology/foodon.owl`, `tools/robot.jar`) are on an explicit deny
  list — they are downloads, not derivations, so re-fetching them is a network round
  trip rather than a build step
- **anything git tracks is skipped**, checked per file against the index rather than
  trusted to the path lists. `repairs-classified.json` and `mined-classified.json`
  look like intermediates and are read by the traversal at startup;
  `resolution-store.json` is a governed decision. A typo in the target list cannot
  destroy a reviewed decision — verified by adding two governed files to the list and
  confirming they were skipped with a reason while the derived files went.

## Getting the two vendor files

Neither is committed: both are large, hash-pinned and downloadable. A fresh clone
needs them before anything will build.

```bash
mkdir -p ontology tools

# FoodOn 2025-12-30 (40 MB). Any release works; the patch layer is re-applied
# against whatever is here, and tools/apply_patches.sh warns when it differs from
# the pinned hash.
curl -L -o ontology/foodon.owl http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/foodon.owl
shasum -a 256 -c ontology/foodon.owl.sha256

# ROBOT 1.9.10 (79 MB)
curl -L -o tools/robot.jar \
  https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/download/v1.9.10/robot.jar
shasum -a 256 -c tools/robot.jar.sha256
```

Both `.sha256` files ARE committed, so a mismatch is visible immediately: for ROBOT
it means the wrong version, and for FoodOn it means a release the local patch layer
has not been reviewed against.

## Layout

```
ontology/    vendor foodon.owl (gitignored) + the local patch layer + merge products
config/      the governed decisions -- see the table below
data/        derived indexes and classified candidate sets
build/       the pipeline, in the order the Build section runs it
build/audit/ one-off discovery scripts, provenance for audit/01-structural-audit.md
build/sparql/ extraction and patch-layer queries
test/        six suites, ~440 assertions
web/         the UI (React + D3, no build step)
tools/       robot.jar and apply_patches.sh
```

`build/` holds three kinds of script and the directory alone does not distinguish
them, so: the **pipeline** ones are exactly those listed in the Build section, in
that order. The **generators** for governed files — `build_function_categories.py`,
`draft_overrides.py`, `make_allergen_golden.py`, `detect_misparent.py` — run rarely
and are safe to re-run: each carries a decision forward rather than restamping it.
`policy_sensitivity.py` is a verification harness cited by
`config/relation_policy.json` as the method behind each direction ruling. Everything
that ran once and produced the structural audit is under `build/audit/`.

Two files look dead and are not, and both now say so at the top: `build/sparql/diag.rq`
(feeds the extraction-completeness check) and `build/build_function_categories.py`
(the only way to regenerate a config the traversal reads).

## Governed files — the decisions, not the code

| file | what it governs |
|---|---|
| `config/relation_policy.json` | which relations propagate avoidance, and in which direction |
| `config/repair-signoff.json` | human rulings on repaired axioms |
| `config/overrides.json` | regulatory and provenance claims the ontology cannot make; `entry_types` documents `add` / `remove` / `declined` / `superseded` |
| `config/mined-signoff.json` | human rulings on bridges mined from FoodOn's prose |
| `data/resolution-store.json` | pinned free-text resolutions |
| `config/function-categories.json` | readable grouping vocabulary over FoodOn's raw CFR groups |

`audit/01-structural-audit.md` records what FoodOn turned out to be like and why each
rule exists. Read it before changing anything that looks arbitrary.

## Grouping for readability

Section 6 asks for culinary-function rollup. FoodOn carries one — 170 US CFR groups
over 2,342 classes — but it is uneven and mixes two axes: `nutritive sweetener` is an
ingredient role, `doughnut` is a finished food. `config/function-categories.json`
folds all 170 into 17 readable categories on two tiers:

- **ingredient_function** — the six categories of the supplied taxonomy: emulsifiers
  and binders, thickeners and gelling agents, sweeteners, preservatives and
  acidulants, clarifying agents, flavour enhancers.
- **product_type** — bakery, confectionery, dairy, beverages, alcohol, meat and
  seafood, sauces and soups, fruit and vegetable, desserts, prepared foods,
  substitutes, eggs, fats and oils.

The second tier exists because most of the CFR vocabulary is product type, and forcing
those into a functional category would be a category error.

**Why not the supplied derivative lists directly.** Measured: naming the derivatives
outright (soy lecithin, HWP, mono- and diglycerides, gelatin, isinglass…) tags 77 of
39,894 classes and **zero** nodes on gluten, soy, tree nut and nightshade queries —
55% of those terms have no FoodOn class, because the list names precisely the
processed ingredients FoodOn models worst. Mapping the CFR vocabulary instead tags
53 corn, 163 milk, 274 gluten and 274 tree-nut nodes. The taxonomy was right; the
route to it had to change.

## The nine things that decide correctness

**No ascent, structurally.** The traversal adjacency contains only edges pointing in
the avoidance-propagating direction; `subClassOf` is indexed parent→child and the
reverse is never added. There is no code path that ascends, so no configuration
mistake can create one. Corn cannot reach wheat because the upward half of that walk
does not exist in the graph. Two negative tests assert it in both directions.

**Direction is never "both".** `derives from` is asserted product→source, so avoidance
travels object→subject. Allowing both directions permits product→source→sibling
product — ascend-then-redescend through a relation instead of through `is_a`. This was
not hypothetical: `part_of` was drafted as `forward` and made a soy query return
lobster and its 73-node subtree.

**Only `contains` enters the closure.** The closure means one thing — treat this as
containing the query — so the four weaker claim types in `config/overrides.json` are
reported beside the graph rather than drawn in it. Their own definitions say why:
`may_contain` is "feedstock is a producer choice", so corn-derived citric acid is
corn-derived *at some producers* and asserting containment states a fact about the
substance that is not true; `cross_reactive` says outright that "the allergen protein
is NOT present", which as a containment edge is wrong in the direction that needlessly
excludes safe food; `disputed` has "no established containment basis";
`shared_compound` is the intolerance case below. All of them used
to be injected exactly like `contains`, which is what `test/allergen_run.py` was
failing on — 11 terms reached by traversal that only a weaker claim supported. Nothing
is dropped: they surface under *Reported, not traversed* with the claim, the reason and
the reviewer's note, and `test/override_run.py` asserts both halves — a `contains`
override must reach the graph, and a weaker one must not, but must still be reported.

**Intolerance is not allergy, and the graph says which.** A diner who cannot take
citrus is often reacting to **citric acid**, not to the fruit proteins — so the
avoidance is real but the containment is not. Commercial citric acid is *Aspergillus
niger* fermentation on a sugar feedstock; the project already carries a signed
`may_contain` linking it to **corn** for that reason. And its FoodOn closure is ten
*imitation* citrus beverage bases — products formulated with citric acid precisely so
they contain no citrus. A `contains` edge from citrus would therefore put on a
citrus-avoider's list the very products that exist to be citrus-free.

The fifth claim type, `shared_compound`, is for exactly this shape: *the query and the
target share the compound that drives a non-immune intolerance response. Neither
derives from the other, and no allergen protein is involved; the compound is the same
molecule whatever its origin.* Three entries carry it — `citric acid` (E330), the
buffered `citrate salt` forms, and `citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides`
(E472c), which smuggles the compound into baked goods where a label gives no hint of
citrus.

It is attached to **all 19 citrus query roots**, not just the genus: someone with this
intolerance types `lemon` or `orange` far more often than `citrus`, and a weak claim is
matched on the resolved root rather than inherited down the hierarchy. No traversal
change was needed — anything that is not `contains` is already collected and reported —
so the cost of a new claim type is its definition, its OWL property, a note in the UI
and a line in the ordering. `test/override_run.py` now also asserts that every claim
used is **declared** in `claim_types`, because a typo would fall through the
not-`contains` branch and be reported rather than drawn: safe by luck rather than by
design.

**Excluded branches are config, not code.** `config/relation_policy.json` lists them
and `build/traverse.py` reads that list. It used to hardcode the agency root while the
policy file described the rule as documentation, so the file named a rule the code
never consulted and a second branch could not be added without editing code. Two
branches are excluded now: `agency food product type` (6,074 classes of parallel
regulatory vocabularies — audit F10) and `embryo` (UBERON:0000922, 12 classes).

The embryo one came out of the union fix. FoodOn parents `embryo` under `animal egg`,
which is defensible — an egg does contain one — but morula, blastula, gastrula and the
2/4/8-cell stages are stages of development, not things on a plate. They are also the
only non-food members of the `animal egg` subtree, which mattered because that class
had to become a root: see below. Measured cost of the exclusion across 18 queries: the
12 classes and nothing else.

**`egg` resolves to three roots.** `egg or egg component` (yolk and white),
`chicken egg`, and `animal egg` — none subsumes another. The third was added after the
union fix, which exposed a false negative on a FALCPA top-9 allergen: `animal egg` had
been reachable only through the inverted edge `animal egg is_a shelled egg`, so
correcting the direction dropped `quail egg`, `goose egg`, `ostrich egg`, `turkey egg`,
`turtle egg` and `animal roe` out of an egg query. Egg allergy is to proteins every
bird egg carries, so the species-spanning class belongs in the roots; the embryology
classes underneath it are handled by the exclusion above rather than by narrowing the
root. Egg: 894 before the union fix → 1,148 after → **1,160** with the third root.

**Union operands are children, not parents.** A named class inside a class expression
points one of two ways, and which one depends on the connective:

| axiom | meaning | count |
|---|---|---|
| `X ≡ A ⊓ B` | X ⊑ A, X ⊑ B — operands are **parents** | 5,254 |
| `X ≡ A ⊔ B` | A ⊑ X, B ⊑ X — operands are **children** | 50 |
| `X ⊑ A ⊔ B` | every X is an A or a B, and **nothing** about X ⊑ A | 13 |
| `X ⊑ A ⊓ B` | operands are parents | 8 |

`build/build_index.py` used to descend `owl:unionOf` and `owl:intersectionOf`
identically, so union operands became parents. A mutual `is_a` **is** an equivalence,
and the result was 50 of them — `nut food product`, `plant seed or nut food product`
and `plant seed food product` collapsed into one class, and so did the aquatic-animal
groupings. Two allergen consequences, both severe:

- a **tree nut** query descended into every plant seed and returned 2,176 classes
  including `rice plant`, `soybean plant`, `buckwheat plant` and `quinoa seed`
- **fish** and **shellfish** returned the *same* 4,508 classes — they were one query,
  though FALCPA treats them as separate allergens

Fixed: union operands under an equivalence are emitted as children; under a
`subClassOf` they yield no subsumption at all and are kept on their own weaker
`isa_union` kind, because recall-first still wants `chia seed (whole or pieces)`
reachable from chia even though we cannot say which operand it is. A union reached
inside a *restriction filler* is neither — `blood meal ≡ derives from some (Bos taurus
or swine)` makes neither a parent nor a child, and that stayed on `rel_nest`.

Mutual pairs went 50 → 4, and the four that remain are genuine FoodOn defects rather
than extraction artefacts (`vegetable ↔ vegetable (whole or pieces)` and three like
it), plus one self-loop (`atlantic cod material is_a atlantic cod material`). Only
four queries moved: tree nut 2,176 → **399**, shellfish 4,508 → **1,314**, fish
4,508 → **3,173**, egg 894 → **1,148**. Everything else is byte-identical and
containment recall stays 23/23. Verified that nothing real was lost: `cashew`,
`pistachio`, `brazil nut` and `pine nut` were already unreachable from a tree-nut
query *before* the fix — that is the FoodOn coverage gap the peanut `remove` override
already documents, not a regression. Three invariants in `test/golden.json` pin it.

**Depth budgets are runaway guards, not policy.** Taxonomic descent and derivative
traversal get separate budgets, each counted from where that phase starts. They used
to share one budget of 6 counted from the query root, and that silently truncated real
answers in two ways at once. `pepper` is a shallow grouping over a deep taxonomy, so
`hungarian wax pepper plant` landed at depth 6 with the budget already spent — its
food products were never looked at, and a `pepper` query returned 147 classes and no
paprika while the *narrower* `Capsicum` returned 177 and found it. The same cap also
lost jalapeño, pimiento, guajillo, pasilla, anaheim and 14 more actual peppers, and
cost `tree nut` 671 classes. Every query saturates well inside the current guard of
12 and the whole set runs in 0.01–0.03s, so the cap costs nothing and exists only so
a future cyclic release cannot spin. How deep an organism sits in FoodOn's taxonomy
is an artefact of how finely that branch was subdivided; it is not a statement about
relevance, and truncating on it hands back a shorter answer with nothing on screen to
say it was shortened.

**Plurals are normalised, but only to a form FoodOn knows.** A diner types
`tomatoes`. FoodOn is inconsistent about which form it carries — `potatoes` is a
synonym upstream and resolved, `tomatoes` was not and returned `absent`. Measured over
84 real singular/plural pairs, 25 plurals failed while the singular worked.

The query as typed always wins; a singular is only tried if it resolves to nothing
usable, so `molluscs`, `sulphites`, `nightshades` and `grits` are never rewritten out
from under themselves. And a candidate singular is accepted **only if FoodOn already
knows it** — an exact hit on a pin, a label, a synonym or a preparation-stripped
label. That guard is the whole point: a bare suffix-stripper is worse than doing
nothing, because `peaches → pea` *resolves*, to pea's 106-class closure instead of
peach's 59. Candidates are tried smallest-edit first, which is what sends `peaches` to
`peach` before it could ever reach `pea`, and `octopuses` to `octopus` rather than
`octopu`. **70 of 72 plural forms now resolve**, 22 of them by this route; the two that
did not were `prawns` (four species, genuinely ambiguous) and `knives`. `prawns` has
since been pinned — see *Culinary vocabulary* below — leaving `knives`, which is not
food.

**A facet is not a sense.** FoodOn splits one ingredient across up to four classes —
the plant, the food, the `<X> food product` grouping and the NCBITaxon taxon. Scoring
those against each other treats them as competing answers, and they are not:
`tomato plant` / `tomato` / `tomato food product` / `Solanum lycopersicum` all returned
the **identical** 164-class closure, sat 1.8 points apart against a margin of 8, and
so `tomato` resolved to nothing at all. The resolver was asking "which one?" where the
answer is "those are the same thing". Facets now merge into a multi-root answer, which
is what `gluten` (five grain species) and `egg` (three classes) already do.

Two tests, and the first is not a heuristic:

- **identical closures** — a proof that the choice cannot change the answer
- **parallel hierarchy** — `expand_roots` links them, the same rank-guarded test used
  for the split Solanaceae hierarchies (audit F4)

Only the longest **prefix** of pairwise-compatible candidates merges, which is what
keeps the traps out: `strawberry` merges 2 and leaves `strawberry tree` (*Arbutus
unedo*) behind; `bean` merges 2 and leaves its polysemous variants behind; `prawn`
(four species), `coffee` and `basil` stay ambiguous for sign-off.

`prawn` has since been **pinned**, which took it off that path — so its trap in
`test/resolution_run.py` now runs against a store-free resolver. A guard that passes
because the code it guards was bypassed has quietly stopped guarding, and pinning one
term is not a decision to stop asserting the merge behaviour underneath it.

**Subsumption is deliberately not a third test.** Measured across 30 cuisine terms it
would merge 70 candidate pairs, and almost all differ by taxonomic **rank** rather
than facet — `Ocimum` (16) contains `Ocimum basilicum` (11), `pepper` (176) contains
`bell pepper` (45). Accepting it widens a species query to its genus, which is exactly
what `config/repair-signoff.json` declines by name for `avian animal`; a resolver may
not do quietly what the repair pass refuses to do explicitly. Two rank pins in
`test/resolution_run.py` hold that line.

Over 107 everyday cuisine terms this took resolution from **82 to 101**. Of the
remainder, `wine`, `beer` and `beef` were never a tuning problem: FoodOn has **no base
class** for any of them, only preparation variants like `wine (dealcoholized)` and
`beef (ground)`. They are now pinned:

| query | root | closure |
|---|---|---|
| `wine` | `wine or wine-like food product` | 106 — chosen over `grape wine` (55) because it carries fruit wine too |
| `beer` | `beer beverage` | 17 — ale, IPA, porter, brown beer, barley malt beer |
| `beef` | `bovine meat food product` | 1,555 → **785** after the override below |

**`red meat` and `alpha-gal` are different questions.** They shared one pin and one
root — `mammal` — which reaches the *animal* rather than the meat and so carried **828
dairy classes**. A diner who simply does not eat red meat was being told to avoid
parmesan and crème fraîche.

They cannot share a root, because the suppression that removes dairy is keyed on the
root. So the pin is split:

| query | root | classes | dairy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `red meat`, `mammalian meat` | `mammalian meat food product` + a signed `remove` | 1,725 | **0** |
| `alpha-gal` and its aliases | `mammal` | 3,130 | **828, deliberately** |

Alpha-gal syndrome is a reaction to galactose-α-1,3-galactose, and that carbohydrate is
present in mammalian **milk** as well as in tissue. So the clinical query keeps dairy and
the culinary one must not: a false positive there costs a diner cheese, a false negative
here costs an allergic diner a reaction. `mammalian meat food product` covers beef, pork,
lamb, venison, prosciutto and corned beef, and excludes poultry and fish by construction.

**Beef needed an override as well as a pin.** Its root reaches `cow food product`,
which carries `in taxon Bos taurus`; the species pivot then walks back down from the
taxon and returns everything else bovine — `cow milk`, `cheddar cheese` and 675 more
dairy classes. A **beef** query was telling a diner to avoid milk. The meat-cut
classes were considered instead — `piece of beef` (320) and `butchery cut of beef`
(286) are dairy-clean — and rejected because they miss every processed form: jerky,
broth, patties, organs. So the pin stays broad and a signed `remove` override
suppresses `milk` for that root, the same mechanism as peanut/tree-nut. Dairy drops
from 677 classes to 25, and those remaining are legitimate: `dairy cow` is a bovine,
and a cheeseburger does contain beef. Verified in both directions — a `milk` query's
1,098 classes contain no beef, because reaching it would require ascending.

### Culinary vocabulary

Nine further terms are pinned for a different reason: FoodOn has the ingredient, but
not under the name a diner uses for it. They were found by running the deterministic
resolver against a query-time LLM over 40 realistic diner phrasings, with the LLM's
answers written blind to a file before any lookup. Over those 40: **26 tie, 9 to the
LLM, 5 to the resolver**.

| query | pinned to | closure | the gap it closes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mangetout` | `snow pea plant` | 11 | British/French name, on no FoodOn label |
| `cilantro` | `coriander` + `coriander plant` | 14 | was reaching `Coriandrum sativum` (8), thin but not wrong |
| `creme fraiche` | `cream (cultured)` | 1 | upstream only as an excluded EFSA code-list entry |
| `double cream` | `heavy cream` | 1 | same product, US name |
| `greek yoghurt` | `greek yogurt` | 1 | a spelling gap, nothing more |
| `chilli flakes` | `chili pepper` | 160 | British spelling plus a form FoodOn does not model |
| `smoked paprika` | `paprika (ground)` + `paprika puree` | 2 | agrees with the bare `paprika` pin |
| `san marzano tomatoes` | the three `tomato` facets | 164 | a cultivar FoodOn does not carry |
| `prawns` | `shrimp` | 214 | FoodOn commits to the American name |

**Two of these are deliberately narrow.** `creme fraiche` and `double cream` could
have gone to `cream food product` (61 — clotted cream, whipped cream, coffee creamer,
ranch dressing) and did not. Cream is not the allergen, milk is, and `dairy` and
`milk` both already resolve; a diner who says "double cream" is naming an ingredient,
not declaring a dairy allergy. `prawns` is `shrimp` (214) and not `crustacean` (731)
for the same reason — crab and lobster are a different question, and
`shellfish (crustacean)` answers it. The rejects in `test/resolution_run.py` are what
stop a later helpful widening.

**Why these are pinned and not inferred.** Every one is a fixed fact about vocabulary:
mangetout does not stop meaning snow pea between queries. Deciding it once is strictly
better than paying for it on every request, and it keeps the same dish returning the
same answer. The comparison argued the same thing from the other side — the LLM's two
worst answers were `gluten` (`wheat plant` alone, **missing barley, rye, triticale and
oats**) and `white fish` (all 3,173 fish rather than cod, haddock and plaice), both of
which would have silently overridden a signed multi-root decision, and one of which is
a false negative on a major allergen. It also invented `game meat food product`, which
does not exist. Plurals, which prompted the question, came out a **clean tie** — the
normalisation above had already closed that gap.

The store is generated by `build/build_resolution_store.py`, and as of this change it
genuinely is: `wine`, `beer`, `beef` and the third `egg` root had been edited into the
JSON directly, so regenerating would have dropped them. They are back in the
generator, which now reproduces every pre-existing entry byte-for-byte.

**A dish is not the parent of its cooking method.** FoodOn defines

```
Buffalo wing (dish)  ≡  prepared chicken wing ⊓ (food (baked) ⊔ food (deep-fried))
```

The union sits **inside an intersection**, which entails `Buffalo wing ⊑ (baked ⊔ fried)`
and nothing whatever about `food (baked) ⊑ Buffalo wing`. The extraction read those
operands as children — correct for a top-level `X ≡ A ⊔ B`, wrong the moment a union is
nested — and made a chicken dish the parent of **every baked food**. A poultry query
returned 1,200 classes instead of 875 and an egg query 1,160 instead of 882, each
swallowing the same 327-class baked-goods tree: `Irish soda bread`, `apple pie`,
`anisette toast`, `pizza food product`.

Found by asking which ingredients land in a family their name does not suggest — the
same sweep that caught black pepper. `panko → breadcrumbs` was landing in **poultry**
and **egg**, and `baguette → bread` with it.

The fix costs 9 true positives, and they are worth naming: `egg bagel`, `egg raisin
bread`, `butter and egg bread` and six more were reachable *only* through the bogus
path. FoodOn asserts no egg source on any of them, so the bug was masking a real gap
rather than the fix creating one. They belong in the bridge queue.

**Soba is the shape of a `may_contain`.** Soba is a buckwheat noodle, buckwheat is not
a grass, and the class sits correctly outside the gluten closure — so a coeliac filter
passes it. But most commercial soba is cut with wheat flour, often the majority of it,
and 100% buckwheat soba is the exception a package has to declare.

The identity is buckwheat and the wheat is a producer's choice, which is precisely the
line `may_contain` draws. Mapping the ingredient to a wheat class would assert a
containment that is false of the noodle; leaving it silent would hand a coeliac a bowl
of it. So `buckwheat noodle may_contain wheat plant` is **reported beside the graph and
never in it** — a gluten or wheat query shows it under *Reported, not traversed*, with
the reason, and the closure is unchanged.

**Absent is an answer.** Roughly two thirds of everyday allergen vocabulary has no
FoodOn class at all. The resolver says so rather than resolving to something
approximate.

## A third kind of gap: missing `in taxon`

A `citrus` query used to return 308 classes and reach neither `lemon plant` nor
`orange plant`. Not a resolution problem and not a missing `derives from` — a missing
**taxon link**.

FoodOn's plant hierarchy has no genus-level citrus class. Seventeen plant classes hang
directly off `citrus family`, which is **Rutaceae** and therefore *above* the genus, so
a citrus query cannot reach them without ascending — and ascending to the family also
collects *Zanthoxylum*: `prickly ash plant`, `japan pepper plant`, `sansho`,
`uzazi fruit`. In the family, not citrus. FoodOn's own definition says so.

The route that does work is the one FoodOn already uses for six of the seventeen:

```
citrus fruit --is a--> grapefruit --in taxon--> Citrus x paradisi --in taxon--> grapefruit plant
```

`grapefruit` and `grapefruit plant` both carry the species link, so the query walks
fruit → species → plant. For `lemon`, FoodOn asserts it on the **fruit** and omits it
on the **plant**. That is the whole bug.

`config/taxon-bridges.json` supplies the omission, one class at a time:

| class | taxon | brings |
|---|---|---|
| `lemon plant` | *Citrus x limon* | 3 |
| `orange plant` | *Citrus sinensis* | 10 — navel, blood, valencia |
| `sour orange plant` | *Citrus x aurantium* | 3 — bergamot, summer orange |
| `clementine plant` | *Citrus x clementina* | 1 |
| `kumquat plant` | *Citrus japonica* | 2 — oval kumquat |

**308 → 324**, and the marmalades, conserves and lemon teas come with them: they
already had `derives from` edges to the fruit and were stranded behind the same gap.

Two things make this a repair rather than an opinion. The axiom is emitted on
**`RO:0002162`, the ontology's own property** — not a local one — so a SPARQL consumer
reaches `lemon plant` by the identical path it already walks to `grapefruit plant`, and
the materialiser needed no new branch. And the binomial is checkable: `test/run.py`
asserts the eleven classes arrive and the four *Zanthoxylum* stay out, `test/patch_run.py`
asserts the same thing again **through SPARQL**, 5/5 bridges honoured and 4/4 excluded.

Ten more are queued in `requires_signoff` rather than applied. Four are synonymy calls
(`myrtle-leaf orange` → *C. x aurantium*; `palestine sweet lime` → *C. limetta*); five
are hybrids FoodOn has no taxon for at all (`orangelo`, `oroblanco`, `persian lime`,
the Citrofortunella group); one — `citrus honey` — is not a taxon question, since the
honey carries no fruit.

### Two parity holes this exposed, one of them closed

Adding a seventh root to `test/patch_run.py` broke a parity claim that six roots had
never tested. Both pre-existing.

**Unpinned correspondences — fixed.** The emitter wrote `local:sameOrganismAs` only
for roots in `data/resolution-store.json`, so the export was parity-correct for pinned
queries and quietly wrong for every other one. `citrus fruit` is not pinned, so its
pairing with `citrus fruit food product` — worth 50 classes — was never written, and a
SPARQL consumer under-reported that root while the app did not.

It now emits the whole relation: **19 correspondences → 803**. The five-minute
estimate for that scan was wrong, and wrong in an instructive way — `expand_roots`
rebuilt its 39,894-entry label index on *every call*, so measuring it by calling it
2,000 times measured the rebuild, not the work. Hoisting the index makes the full scan
**0.04s**, and made each query's `expand_roots` 60× faster as a side effect (7.75ms →
0.12ms).

The rule now lives in one place, `Graph.all_correspondences()`, which both the emitter
and the test call — the application's rule and the exported rule cannot drift apart,
which is the failure this whole layer exists to prevent. `patch_run.py` asserts parity
on `citrus fruit` **because it is unpinned**: that root is the regression test.

The taxon-pivot half is deliberately not emitted. `local:pivotsTo` already carries it
and `patch_closure.rq` already walks it, so emitting it again would be 2,587 triples
saying what the graph says.

**Nested-filler subsumption — fixed.** FoodOn states some parents and some ingredient
links only *inside* a class expression: a named class sitting in a restriction filler,
or an operand of `X ⊑ (A ⊔ B)`. No `rdfs:subClassOf` triple exists for those and **no
reasoner will infer one** — `X ⊑ A ⊔ B` says every X is an A or a B and refuses to say
which. The application extracts them anyway on its weaker edge kinds (`rel_nest`,
`isa_union`) because recall-first wants them; SPARQL walking `rdfs:subClassOf` saw none
of it.

563 of them are now exported: 149 weak subsumptions on a new `local:weaklyUnder`, and
414 nested propagating relations folded into the `local:propagatesTo` the materialiser
already writes. Taken **from `data/index.json`, not re-derived in SPARQL** — the
extraction rule is 60 lines of tree-walking with a direction rule that has been wrong
before, and a second implementation of it would be a second thing to keep correct.

Each weak subsumption is emitted **twice**, which is exactly how an ordinary subclass
edge is consumed: `patch_closure.rq` descends `^rdfs:subClassOf` in phase one and
`local:propagatesTo` in phase two, so a weak parent must be walkable in both. With only
the phase-one form, `citrus fruit` reached `imitation orange juice drink` and `Citrus`
did not — from `Citrus` the same class sits one `derives from` further along.

### How far parity actually holds

`test/patch_run.py` asserts **eight** roots at exact parity, each chosen for a
mechanism: the species pivot, a union filler, a supplied `in taxon` link, an *unpinned*
root, a class defined inside a class expression. Twice now, adding a ninth revealed a
hole the eight could not see — so `build/audit/parity_sweep.py` sweeps every pinned
root instead. It is a diagnostic, not a test.

**29 of 38 roots at exact parity.** The nine that do not are unrelated to the two holes
above — verified: none of their diverging classes touches a nested edge — and fall into
three groups:

| | roots | direction |
|---|---|---|
| `remove` overrides suppress a subtree; the SPARQL filter only walks `propagatesTo*` ancestors, not `rdfs:subClassOf` descendants | `nut producing plant` | over-reports |
| terminal namespaces (CHEBI stops expansion in the app; the query knows nothing of them) | `sulfites`, `coriander plant` | over-reports |
| multi-root allergens whose co-roots and override edges the query does not compose | `egg or egg component`, `chicken egg`, `animal egg`, `mammal`, `bovine meat food product`, `mollusc` | under-reports |

The third group is the one that matters for safety and is the largest: `egg or egg
component` returns 1,147 classes in the app and 162 in SPARQL.

## Ingesting recipes

`build/ingest.py` turns a cookbook line into a FoodOn class, or into nothing. Measured
on **5,000 real recipes** — 54,004 ingredient uses, 9,087 distinct terms after
normalisation:

| stage | | cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| normalise | quantity, unit, parenthetical, preparation | 48.4% of uses |
| strip culinary qualifiers | grade and state words FoodOn does not label | **68.6%** |
| ~~head noun~~ | the last word of whatever is left | ~~89.7%~~ **removed** |

**The head-noun stage is deliberately absent, and it is the only thing that would take
this past 90%.** It got there by dropping the modifier that carried the food:

```
chili oil            -> oil        a nightshade-avoider is served chili oil
ancho chile powder   -> powder
goat cheese          -> cheese
squeezed lemon juice -> juice
```

1,921 ingredient uses collapse that way. For a filter whose job is keeping food off a
plate the trade runs backwards — an unresolved ingredient **quarantines** a recipe, a
wrongly resolved one **passes** it. 68% that abstains is worth more than 90% that
guesses, so `ingest.py` has three outcomes and no fourth: resolved, unresolved,
ambiguous.

The qualifier stage is where the volume is and it costs nothing: `kosher salt` (3,205
uses), `unsalted butter` (1,147), `all-purpose flour` (647), `granulated sugar` (321)
all resolve once grade words come off. Whole corpus in about five seconds.

### The review queue

What is left is judgement, not lookup, and it goes in `config/ingredient-map.json`.
`build/seed_ingredient_map.py` builds the queue from a corpus, ordered by **use** —
the vocabulary is steeply headed, so 500 terms carry 15% of the corpus on top of the
68% already handled.

Nothing it writes is active. Proposals land in `requires_signoff`; `ingest.py` reads
only entries carrying `signed_off_by`, and `test/ingest_run.py` asserts that an unsigned
mapping cannot take effect. A pipeline that applied its own suggestions would make the
review theatre.

Each proposal arrives with candidates already resolved, so the reviewer answers *is
`red pepper flakes` chili pepper?* rather than going to look it up — and a candidate
that would drop a food says so:

```
red pepper flakes       322 uses  ->  red pepper
dijon mustard           143       ->  mustard
unseasoned rice vinegar 127       ->  vinegar    ** dropping `rice` loses the food
parmesan                197       ->  (no candidate, needs a human)
```

### Sweeping for the wrong family

`build/audit/family_sweep.py` — two sweeps over a recipe corpus, run against every major
avoidance family, and worth re-running after any change to the mappings. The
first asks which ingredients land in a family their name does not suggest — that caught
black pepper pointing at Capsicum, and `panko → breadcrumbs` landing in **poultry**,
which turned out to be the nested-union extraction bug. It is now clean: every remaining
flag is correct (`chives → allium`, `tomatoes → nightshade`, and `creme fraiche →
alpha-gal`, which is deliberate).

The second sweep asks the dangerous question — which ingredients name a family and do
**not** land in it — and found the worst defect in the project:

```
a gluten query rejected      312 of 5,000 recipes
and missed                   988 that named a grain
```

FoodOn's **generic** grain classes carry no source, and correctly so: bread can be made
from any grain. But a recipe that says `flour` means wheat flour, and the ingredient map
was pointing `flour` (647 recipes), `bread`, `breadcrumbs`, `panko` and `cracker` at
those generic classes. A coeliac filter was catching under a quarter of what it should.

Pointing the unqualified culinary terms at the wheat classes — the same judgement as
`pepper → black pepper` — takes it to **1,090 rejected and 160 missed**, and the
remaining 160 are almost all genuinely gluten-free: `rice flour`, `chickpea flour`,
`buckwheat noodle`. That is the other half of the judgement, and the golden case asserts
both halves: the default must catch `flour`, and must not swallow `rice flour`.

**Both sweeps are now clean.** Working through what they found — black pepper out of
the nightshade family, the nested-union extraction bug, the gluten defaults, six
ingredients out of `Chile` the country, mayonnaise, and a last batch of seven orphans —
took the misses sweep from 27 rows to 12, and **all 12 are cue-word noise**:
`lemongrass` is not citrus, `almond flour` and `quinoa flour` are correctly not gluten,
`apple butter` and `butter beans` are not dairy, `oyster mushrooms` are not molluscs.

The sweeps keep their noise on purpose. A cue list tight enough to produce no false
flags would be a cue list that stops finding things, and every real defect this project
has found came from reading a noisy list rather than from a clean one.

### The proposals

`build/propose_ingredient_map.py` attaches a model's answers to the queue **under
contract**: the model proposes a *term*, and `build/resolve.py` must then find it. A
proposal the resolver cannot find is refused and recorded as refused — it never reaches
a reviewer as a recommendation.

That guard is not theoretical. On the first pass it refused **22 of my own proposals**:
`rice vinegar`, `basil plant`, `goat cheese`, `mirin`, `bread crumb`, `vegetable broth`
— all things a cook would name and FoodOn does not carry. What it has instead is
`mirin japanese`, `basil leaf`, `goat milk cheese food product`, `breadcrumbs`. Without
the guard those 22 would have entered the queue looking exactly as confident as the 273
that were right.

Abstention is a first-class answer: `null` where FoodOn has nothing (`gochujang`,
`furikake`, `guanciale` — the ingredient quarantines its recipe), and a decline where
the line is not an ingredient at all. 42 of the 500 are declines, and they are the
parser's failures rather than the ontology's: `deep-fry thermometer`, `springform pan`,
`skinless`, `fl`, `ml`, and nine lines like `kosher salt black pepper` where *and* welded
two ingredients into one.

Current state: **273 proposed, 42 declined, 10 abstained**. If every proposal were
approved, 71% of the queued uses would map.

### Approving in batches

The **Ingredient mappings** tab of `audit.html` reviews them. The queue is ordered by
**use**, because the vocabulary is steeply headed — the top 20 terms carry about a third
of it — so working top-down buys the most coverage per decision and working
alphabetically buys the least.

**The final call is a human picking a class, not approving a string.** Every row shows
a shortlist of actual FoodOn classes — id, label, closure size — with the model's
narrowing leading as *recommended* and the alternatives under it, so a reviewer can
overrule without leaving the page:

```
red wine vinegar   229 uses
  (*) wine vinegar    FOODON:03301228    4 in closure   RECOMMENDED
  ( ) vinegar         FOODON:03301705   37 in closure   dropping `red wine`
  ( ) red wine        FOODON:03310272   20 in closure   lexical: `red wine`
```

Closure size is on every row because it is the number that decides whether a class is
the right grain: FoodOn's own `tree nut` reaches 2 classes and looks perfect. The
shortlist is filtered to namespaces a food can live in — PATO carries `red` and `white`
as *qualities*, and they were arriving as candidates for `red wine vinegar`, where
clicking one would map an ingredient to the colour of itself.

**Specificity outranks the proposal.** A class whose label contains *every* word of the
term leads the shortlist, because a proposal got where it is by *discarding* words.
`rice vinegar` was proposed as `vinegar` — correct but coarse — while
`FOODON:03307370 rice wine vinegar` sits directly under `wine vinegar` and says exactly
what the recipe said. Substring search never found it: `rice vinegar` is not a substring
of `rice wine vinegar`. Word-subset search is, and it ranks by fewest extra words.

**Excluded-branch classes are never offered.** 6,087 EFSA and GS1 code-list classes sit
outside the traversal by policy, so a mapping to one would be a mapping that silently
never fires. They are filtered out of every shortlist and refused on approval, with the
reason given.

**A term the resolver gets *wrong* can be overridden.** The queue holds only terms the
resolver cannot settle, so one it settles wrongly has no entry anywhere. `pepper`
resolved cleanly to `FOODON:00003520` — which is **Capsicum**, and sits inside the
nightshade closure — while all 110 of its lines in the 5,000-recipe corpus read
"freshly ground pepper" or "Pepper". Approving a class for a term that is neither
queued nor signed creates the override and records it as one.

That correction plus five like it is worth measuring: a nightshade query over the
corpus went from **1,701 recipes rejected to 1,496** — 205 meals handed back to a
diner who was losing them to a seasoning that is not a nightshade. `aleppo pepper` and
`shishito peppers` keep their own mappings and are still correctly rejected.

**A signed mapping can be corrected.** One signed in good faith and later found coarse
has to be fixable in the interface rather than by hand-editing the file the interface
exists to replace. The *signed* filter lists them with their current class pre-selected
and the alternatives under it; a correction records `corrected_from` and keeps the
original sign-off date.

A chosen id is stored **as an IRI and used as one**. Re-resolving its label at ingest
time would put the resolver's scoring back in the path, so a reviewer's override could
quietly land somewhere else after an unrelated change.

Filters split the queue by the kind of decision it needs: *one click* (172, a single
candidate), *needs a choice* (250), *no class in FoodOn* (54), *proposed decline* (42).
**`Select all shown` is scoped to the current filter on purpose** — a button that took
all 500 regardless of what was on screen would make it trivial to wave through the ones
needing a judgement along with the obvious ones.

Approving **re-checks that the target still resolves**. A proposal was validated when it
was made, and the vendor ontology is the one thing this project expects to be swapped;
signing off a mapping that no longer resolves would put a dead entry in the ingestion
path, where it fails silently and quietly stops protecting whoever relied on it. The
skipped ones come back named.

Approval takes effect immediately — `build/ingest.py` reads the signed mappings on its
next run, and no `.ttl` regeneration is involved, because the ingredient map feeds
ingestion rather than the patch layer.

The risk flag fires when a **dropped word is itself a food**. An earlier version flagged
anything collapsing onto a generic noun, which buried `chili oil` and `goat cheese` under
warnings about `maldon` and `distilled`. It still over-flags some brand names; that costs
a glance, not a mistake.

Kept separate from `data/resolution-store.json` on purpose. That file pins what a
**diner** means by a word — 53 entries carrying long arguments about allergen scope.
This one records what a **recipe writer** means, runs to hundreds of mostly-mechanical
entries, and wants a different review burden. Merging them would bury the reasoned
decisions in the routine ones.

## Auditing the patch layer

`http://localhost:8790/audit.html`, served by the same process as the graph.

The layer is 233 decisions across six files. A list of them answers *what did we
change*; a kitchen needs *what does this tool say about beef, and how much of that is
ours*. So each row runs the query **twice** — once against the full graph, once against
a `Graph(repairs=None, mined=None, taxon_bridges=None, overrides=[])` — and reports the
difference:

```
beef       1,555 -> 785    -770      the dairy suppression
tree nut     481 -> 399    +9 / -91  the peanut separation, 1 queued
gluten       854 -> 864    +10
mollusc      555 -> 555    unchanged
```

Two things that only this framing made visible. **The layer is overwhelmingly a
suppression layer** — across 21 ingredients it adds 27 classes and suppresses 861, and
the two `remove` overrides account for 861 of that. Every conversation about this
project has been about *adding* bridges. And **14 of 21 ingredients need no audit at
all**: they return exactly what FoodOn returns, so they collapse into a separate
section and the real audit surface is seven ingredients.

**Edits write to the governed decision files, never to the `.ttl`.** The `.ttl` is
generated from them and `test/patch_run.py` fails on a hand-edit, so an editor that
wrote Turtle would be writing what the next build discards. Saving runs
`emit_patches.py` and reloads the served graph in ~0.3s; the ROBOT merge that SPARQL
consumers need is a separate button, because it is a separate 19s cost, and a banner
says when the exported graph is behind.

The write path refuses what it should: an undeclared claim type, a target FoodOn does
not have, a pin root label that does not resolve, a claim with no query root, and
**repointing an existing claim** — target and roots are a claim's identity, so retiring
it and adding a new one keeps the trail. `test/audit_run.py` asserts those guards and
the arithmetic behind the bars.

### Statements, not files

The first edit form offered `reason`, `confidence` and `review_note` — prose *about* a
relationship, with no way to state one. Six files with six field vocabularies stood
between a reviewer and the sentence they wanted to write.

Every decision in the layer is **subject — predicate — object**, and the predicate
decides which file it lands in, so nobody picks a file:

| predicate | enters the closure | lands in |
|---|---|---|
| `derives from` `RO:0001000` | yes | `overrides.json` as `contains` |
| `is a` | yes | `mined-signoff.json` |
| `in taxon` `RO:0002162` | yes | `taxon-bridges.json` |
| `may derive from` / `shares compound with` / `cross reactive with` / `disputed for` | no | `overrides.json` |
| `not relevant for` | suppresses | `overrides.json` as `remove` |

Both ends are chosen by **typing a name**, not by pasting an IRI: the picker searches
labels then synonyms and shows each candidate's closure size, because that is the
number that decides whether a candidate is the right grain — FoodOn's own `tree nut`
class looks perfect and reaches 2 classes.

**Every write path previews, including the override forms.** An override is a statement
wearing different field names — a target, a claim, some query roots — so
`/api/audit/preview` takes either shape and both get the same answer from the same code.
Adding or editing a claim shows what it would do to each of its query roots before it is
saved, and changing the claim type re-previews: `contains` reports what a query gains,
`remove` what it loses, and a weak claim says *reported beside the graph, not in it*.

That path had no preview until a suppression I wrote landed on `chicken meat food
product` in silence. `FOODON:00001040` is a real class, so nothing objected, and a
red-meat query kept all 828 of its dairy classes. **The target field is now a class
picker rather than an IRI box** — both silent mis-writes in this layer came from typing
an IRI that named a real but wrong class.

**Nothing is saved without a preview.** `/api/audit/preview` applies the statement to an
in-memory graph — the same mutations `traverse.py` makes when it loads a decision file,
so a preview cannot drift from what saving does — and reports which pinned ingredients
change and by how much. It earns its place: while this was being built it caught a
mistyped IRI of mine, `fermented beverage` where `pasta food product` was meant, which
read on screen as *"gluten gains Barbera wine"*.

The rank guard runs in the preview too: `lemon plant in taxon Citrus` is refused,
because a genus there silently widens every query beneath it.

**Repointing is retire-and-restate.** Editing a claim's target in place would rewrite
history — the entry would claim to have always said the new thing, and every test would
still pass. `Retire` marks it `superseded` with a reason and leaves both halves on the
record.

### Two defects this view found in the data

**`remove` entries spelled the field `query_root` while `add` entries spelled it
`query_roots`.** Consumers that read one spelling silently dropped the other, which is
how the two largest decisions in the layer — peanut/tree-nut and beef/dairy — went
missing from an audit that otherwise looked complete. The field is now plural
everywhere, readers tolerate both, and `override_run` asserts the data stays uniform.

**The 53 pinned resolutions lived as `E(...)` calls in a Python script**, so the part
of the layer edited most often was the part no interface could reach. They are now
`config/resolution-pins.json`; `build/build_resolution_store.py` is the loader, and it
resolves each root **label** to an IRI so a class FoodOn relabels fails the build loudly
rather than silently pinning nothing. The migration was verified byte-identical against
the committed store.

## The decision files check themselves

`test/decisions_run.py` — **3,206 assertions** over seven governed files, against the
release they claim to describe.

The interface validates what it writes; the files do not, and both silent mis-writes in
this layer arrived by a script editing JSON directly. `FOODON:00001040` is `chicken meat
food product`, not `mammalian meat food product`. `FOODON:03411318` is `cacao plant`, not
`rye plant`. Both are **real classes**, so every existence check passed and nothing
objected — a red-meat query kept all 828 of its dairy classes in the meantime.

The check that catches those is the **label/IRI pair**. Almost every IRI in these files
sits beside a human-readable label, written by the same hand at the same moment. When
they disagree, the label says what was *meant* and the IRI says what was *written*:

```
config/overrides.json.overrides[32]: `query_root_labels` says "mammalian meat food
product" but `query_roots` points at "chicken meat food product"
```

Verified by injecting both real slips and confirming each fails. It also catches an IRI
that is not a class in this release, a class deprecated upstream, an undeclared claim or
entry type, a signed entry with no signature, a pin whose root label FoodOn no longer
has, and a mapping to an excluded branch — which can never match a query and reads as
done.

## Bridges awaiting review

FoodOn omits `derives from` on 62% of its `<X> food product` classes.
`build/repair_derives.py` recovers 76 of them from the naming convention plus two
structural guards — that is the edge that connects paprika to nightshade.
`build/classify_mined.py` covers what the convention cannot see, and puts every
candidate in a **review queue rather than the graph**:

| rule | source of evidence | in queue |
|---|---|---|
| E | FoodOn's own definitions (`pasta` is "an unleavened dough of wheat flour") | 11 |
| B | interior qualifier: `<X> <qualifier> food product` → `<X> <source>` | 1 |
| D | preparation-state twin, emitted as the missing `is a` it actually is | 13 |

**Signed so far: 10.**

| bridge | effect |
|---|---|
| `pasta → wheat plant`, `whole wheat pasta → wheat plant` | gluten 829 → 863 |
| `malt syrup → barley plant` | gluten → 864, barley 48. A classic hidden gluten source |
| `mustard condiment food product → mustard plant` | mustard 37 → 47: dijon, mustard sauce, relish, mostarda di frutta |
| `yellow mustard (prepared) → white mustard plant` | adds the species-level route, so a `white mustard` / *Sinapis alba* query reaches it too |
| `soy-based protein powder → soybean plant` | soy 133 → 134 |
| `acorn flour → oak tree` | reachable from oak and, correctly, from a tree-nut query — an acorn is a nut |
| `croziflette → buckwheat plant` | **medium** confidence, deliberately — see below |
| `tahini → sesame plant`, `white tahini → sesame plant` | sesame stays at 19, but on **structure instead of curation** — `Sesame → tahini` is now reported redundant in `override_run.py` |

`croziflette` is the only entry signed at **medium**. Its definition reads "crozets
de Savoie (usually made from buckwheat **but sometimes durum**)" — a recipe choice,
the same shape as the `may_contain` overrides that are kept out of the closure.
Signed anyway under recall-first, because buckwheat allergy is anaphylactic and
crozets usually *are* buckwheat, so the over-inclusion falls in the safe direction.
Two gaps it does not close, recorded in the sign-off so nobody reads the dish as
mapped: it is a multi-component dish that also contains milk (reblochon), pork
(bacon) and allium (onion), none of which FoodOn asserts; and the durum variant means
it may contain gluten, which will not show on a gluten query since buckwheat is
gluten-free.

The malt entry is the one that needed an argument. Its definition hedges — "a syrup
made from malted barley **or grains**" — but FoodOn keeps the generic reading in a
separate class (`malted cereal syrup`, under flavoring syrup), keeps `rice syrup`
separate again under plant sweetener, and already parents `malt extract` under
`barley product flavoring`. That last one is the ontology's own statement that
unqualified malt means barley. Verified after signing: neither `malted cereal syrup`
nor `rice syrup` is pulled into a gluten query.

That last row is the direction of travel: a signed override replaced by an axiom
FoodOn's own prose already contained. The `Sesame → tahini` override has since been
**retired** — `type: "superseded"`, not deleted, because the record of why the gap
existed is the useful part. `test/override_run.py` keeps that retirement honest: a
superseded entry's target must still be reached, and not by an override, or the test
fails and names the entry to reinstate. Verified by removing the mined bridge, which
produced exactly that failure. Retiring an override without this check would be an
untested deletion of a safety claim.

`test/mined_run.py` reports `white tahini` as redundant — it is `is a tahini`, so it
arrives by descent; it is kept as a direct anchor against a future re-parenting, the
same treatment as the sodium caseinate override.

The broader `pasta food product` was deliberately **not** signed — see below.

Nothing here changes an answer. `config/mined-signoff.json` is keyed by **product
IRI** — not by source label as `config/repair-signoff.json` is — because a mined
bridge rests on one class's own prose sentence and is evidence for exactly that
class. `test/mined_run.py` asserts the queue is inert and that a signed entry
actually fires.

**Five guards, each earned from a real false positive.** 295 of 330 candidates are
rejected: 182 already reachable, 103 external code-list rows, and then the ones that
matter — `pear tomato plant → pear plant` (the product is itself an organism; a pear
tomato is a tomato), `food milling → grain plant` (a process has no origin),
`enzyme supplement → pineapple plant` (the definition reads "plants like pineapple
and papaya" — an example list, not an origin), and `chocolate (imitation) → chocolate`
(an analog is defined by *not* containing what it imitates, which is why
`has food substance analog` is non-propagating in the relation policy).

**Every candidate carries its impact, because one of them needs it.** Dry-running
`pasta food product → wheat plant` grew a gluten query from 829 to 964 classes and
pulled in `gluten-free pasta` — `pasta food product` is a shape, not a grain. The
queue reports `+119` against that entry and names the conflict, so it reads as a
decline-or-narrow decision rather than a free win. `pasta → wheat plant` (+6) and
`whole wheat pasta` (+1) are the clean parts of the same finding.

**Not implemented, on purpose.** Product-form suffixes (`<X> oil`, `<X> sauce`,
`<X> syrup`) were measured at ~50% precision: `pancake syrup → pancake`,
`malt syrup → malt root` (it is barley), `feather meal → feather`. `<X> sauce` and
`<X> syrup` name the dish, not the source, and no guard separates the two cases.
Definition mining gets `malt syrup → barley plant` right from the prose instead, and
`test/mined_run.py` fails if rule C ever appears in the queue.

## Coverage

Against the supplied allergen derivative list (103 terms across 12 allergens), scored
by relation type because the list conflates four relations that need different
machinery:

| relation | result |
|---|---|
| containment | **23/23 reached** of those FoodOn has a class for |
| synonym | 4/4 resolve into the right closure |
| provenance / cross-reactive / disputed | 0 reached by structure — no false containment; 20 carried as reported claims |

## Known limits

- **48 of 71 containment terms do not exist in FoodOn at all.** `soy lecithin`,
  `whey protein concentrate`, `ovalbumin`, `bovine gelatin`, `isinglass`, `seitan`,
  `triticale`, `kamut`. No traversal work changes that; it is the single largest
  limit on the system and it is a data-availability problem.
- FoodOn parents processed ingredients by function (`tahini is_a condiment`,
  `casein is_a protein extract`) and asserts no source. Five such derivatives are
  reachable only through signed overrides, not through structure.
- 11 `may_contain` entries are signed but **reported rather than traversed**: the
  source is genuinely open (corn, wheat, cassava, beet or molasses by producer and
  region), so a corn query lists citric acid, xanthan gum, ascorbic acid and calcium
  citrate under *Reported, not traversed* instead of drawing them as containment.
  Revisit if a product-level layer can supply the actual source.
- 7 override targets, including `sorbitol` and `modified food starch`, name terms with
  no FoodOn class, so there is nothing to point an edge at; they surface as text in
  the same panel.
- Two FoodOn defects are recorded in `data/misparented.json`: `rye kernel` is parented
  under `sumac food product`, and `hickory nut` (with `pecan` beneath it) under
  `mustard spinach food product`. Both are allergen false negatives.
- Certified gluten-free oats cannot be expressed here. Oats count as gluten-containing
  by decision; the exception is a product-label fact and must be handled downstream.

## The baked-goods dairy policy

A dairy-avoiding diner got no protection from any cookie, biscuit or cake in the
ontology: none of them carried dairy. Per class that is defensible — a cookie *can* be
made without butter — and in aggregate it is alarming, because baked goods are among the
most reliably buttered things on a menu. Five single claims in a row (the butterscotch
family) made it clear this wanted deciding once rather than one baked good at a time.

**Enriched baked goods default to containing dairy. Lean doughs do not.**

The split is by method, not by category. A lean dough is flour, water, yeast and salt;
an enriched one needs butter, milk or both to be the thing it is named after. This is
the same shape as the gluten default, which had to catch `flour` without swallowing
`rice flour`, and `test/override_run.py` asserts **both halves** for the same reason —
half an assertion would let the policy drift into rejecting every bread, or into
reaching nothing.

| | classes | |
|---|---|---|
| **enriched** → contains dairy | `cookie` 106, `cake food product` 62, `doughnut` 17, `pastry` 7, plus `scone`, `croissant`, `muffin`, `waffle`, `pancake`, `cornbread` | 139 newly reach dairy |
| **lean** → unchanged | bread, breadcrumbs, panko, pita, tortilla, bagel, sourdough, phyllo, matzo | 224 classes stay dairy-free |

Asserted on **anchors, not labels**. A regex over 301 matching labels would have caught
`puff pastry shortening` (which is shortening, the *non*-butter fat), `cow milk cheese
cake` (already dairy), and a run of excluded EFSA code-list rows. Four anchor classes
plus six singles carry it structurally instead, and the closure does the rest.

Checked for the rice-flour trap: **`rice cake` is not under `cake food product`**, so the
equivalent false positive does not exist here.

### What it actually cost, and why that number is misleading

Projected **+70 recipes** on the 5,000-recipe corpus. Realised **+4** — dairy rejection
went 2,111 → 2,115.

The gap is not good news, and it should not be read as the policy being cheap. The
projection counted lines whose *text* named an enriched baked good; the policy only
reaches lines that *resolve to a class*. Most of them do not:

```
1 sheet frozen puff pastry   absent        graham cracker crumbs   absent
4 sheets phyllo dough        absent        2 brioche buns          absent
one box puff pastry          absent        ladyfingers             absent
```

So the policy is nearly free here because the ingest coverage for prepared baked goods
is poor, not because it is well targeted. Its value arrives as those terms get mapped —
and until they are, a recipe calling for puff pastry is quarantined rather than
cleared, which is the safe failure but not a working one.

## Certification claims: identity in the ontology, the certificate in the app

`halal beef tenderloin` used to resolve to **nothing**. Not beef, not cattle, not red
meat, not alpha-gal. Writing the word `halal` on a line made the beef invisible to the
allergen filter — the dangerous direction to fail in, and a diner avoiding alpha-gal
would not have been protected by it. `organic` worked only by accident of having been
added to `QUAL` for unrelated reasons, and even then the word was destroyed.

Both halves were wrong. A certification word has to strip, so identity survives it, and
has to be kept, so the app knows this line carries a claim someone must stand behind.
`ingest.line()` now returns both:

```
2 lb halal beef tenderloin  ->  term "beef tenderloin", reaches alpha-gal,
                                claims ["halal"]
```

The claim is a **claim, not a fact**: the line says someone asserted it. Whether a
certificate stands behind it is a product-level question this layer cannot answer.

**Claims do not inherit, and this is the trap.** Containment flows downstream and is
monotone — beef → beef tenderloin → beef stock all carry beef, and no processing removes
it. A certificate flows nowhere: a halal-certified tenderloin does not make a stock
halal, because shared equipment or one unsupervised step breaks it. So claims are
recorded against the line and never propagated through the closure, however much the
problem looks like the one the graph already solves.

Names are canonical rather than whatever the supplier wrote, so `grassfed` and
`grass-fed` are one claim and so are `non-GMO` and `GMO-free`. Across the 5,000-recipe
corpus: organic 85, gluten-free 35, free-range 23, pasture-raised 8, grass-fed 6,
dairy-free 5, wild-caught 3, non-GMO 3, kosher 3, pareve 1.

### `kosher` is usually not a claim

22 lines in the corpus carry the word and 18 of them mean salt or a pickle. It has to
survive three exclusions, each measured rather than guessed:

| excluded | because |
|---|---|
| `kosher or sea salt`, `Kosher or coarse salt`, `Pinch of kosher` | a crystal grade named for koshering meat, asserting nothing about the salt. A lookahead for `kosher salt` alone caught none of these |
| `kosher dill pickle` | a pickle style — garlic-brined, named after delicatessen practice |
| `turkey (not kosher)` | reported a kosher *claim* before this: a line recorded as saying the opposite of what it says |

What survives is what should: `kosher gelatin`, `kosher beef salami`, `a kosher bird`.
22 claims became 4, three of them genuine.

## Validating against a corpus we did not curate

`build/validate_corpus.py` runs the mapping layer over an outside corpus and reports
two things. The first is coverage. The second is the one that could not be got any
other way.

```bash
python3 build/validate_corpus.py file /path/to/recipes.json --limit 500
python3 build/validate_corpus.py themealdb --limit 200          # free, no key
python3 build/validate_corpus.py openfoodfacts --limit 300      # free, ODbL
```

A corpus of our own choosing can only show what we failed to map. A corpus that carries
its own allergen labels can show what we got **wrong**, and internal review cannot
produce that however careful it is. Open Food Facts tags products with the 14
declarable allergens; all 14 resolve here, so every labelled product is a comparison.

The rule that makes the comparison honest is about completeness:

| the label says milk, we find no dairy, and… | verdict |
|---|---|
| every ingredient resolved | a real traversal defect — start here |
| something did not resolve | explained by the coverage gap; not a traversal claim |

Counting the second as a defect would invent bugs we do not have; counting it as
nothing would hide the gap. They are reported in separate columns. The reverse — we
reach an allergen the label omits — is reported too, but weighted lower on purpose:
Open Food Facts allergen tags are contributor-entered and often incomplete, so it is as
likely to be the label's omission as our error. A lead, not a defect.

`test/oracle_run.py` pins that classification against a fixture written by hand rather
than fetched. Open Food Facts is ODbL, and a share-alike obligation on a corpus
committed to a repository with no licence chosen is not a thing to acquire by accident;
the cache under `data/validation-cache/` is not committed for the same reason.

### What the first runs said

Against 150 Open Food Facts products, the oracle found **two real misses, both on one
product** — a peanut butter spread whose ingredients read `PEANUTS, SUGAR, PALM OIL,
SALT, MOLASSES` and which is tagged both gluten and tree-nut. That is a mislabelled
product, not a traversal failure. Against the declared allergens the traversal did not
disagree with a single correctly-labelled item.

The gap it did find is the one already written down under `Known limits`, now measured:

- **Line resolution falls from 77.4% on recipes to 53.4% on packaged goods.** The
  unresolved tail is `soy lecithin`, `natural flavors`, `enzymes`, `cheese cultures`,
  `niacin`, `reduced iron` — label vocabulary that barely occurs in a cookbook.
- **Milk, soy and gluten each go undecided on 12–17 of 150 products** purely because an
  ingredient did not resolve. Nothing was decided wrongly; a great deal could not be
  decided at all.
- TheMealDB, faceted by cuisine, costs nothing and immediately turns up `sesame seed
  oil` and `soy sauce` — two named allergens — plus `tbs` surviving as a unit and
  British spellings (`chilli`, `icing sugar`) the normaliser does not fold.

Two of those were normaliser defects and are fixed. `tbs` is a second common spelling
of `tbsp`, not a typo, and TheMealDB uses it throughout — so `2 tbs soy sauce` failed
while `3 tbsp soy sauce` resolved, and soy sauce carries both soy and gluten. `whole`
is a unit word (`1 whole chicken`), so stripping it alone turned `whole grain oats`
into `grain oats`, which names nothing, and lost the gluten answer that `oats` carries.
Neither spelling occurs anywhere in the 5,000-recipe corpus, which is the argument for
running the harness at all. TheMealDB went 74.3% → 80.0% of lines and Open Food Facts
10.0% → 14.0% of products fully mapped, with no movement on the recipe corpus.

What the same tail shows that is **not** a normaliser defect: `flax seed`, `cracked
wheat`, `oat fiber` and `sesame seed oil` are absent from FoodOn under those names
while `linseed` → flaxseed, `bulgur`, `oat` and `sesame oil` all resolve. Those are
mapping decisions and need a signature, not a regex. Sesame is a declarable allergen,
so `sesame seed oil` is the one to take first.

The headline number is not 77.4% or 53.4% but **fully-mapped items: 11.4% of recipes
and 10.0% of products.** One unmapped ingredient quarantines the whole item, because a
recipe cannot be cleared for someone with an allergy on the strength of the ingredients
that happened to resolve.

## Hosting it: read-only, behind a password

`vercel.json` and `api/index.py` deploy the server to Vercel. What goes up is **not**
the local app, and three of the differences are forced rather than configured.

**It cannot write, so it does not pretend to.** Vercel's filesystem is read-only apart
from `/tmp`, and `/tmp` does not survive between invocations. An approval would fail,
or — far worse — appear to succeed and vanish. `FOODON_READ_ONLY=1` refuses every
writing endpoint at the server with a 403 that says why, and `audit.js` disables the
controls when `/api/audit` reports the flag, because a button that looks live and then
fails is worse than one that is plainly inert. `test/readonly_run.py` asserts this over
real HTTP against a real server, since the UI half is a courtesy and anyone can POST.

Read-only is **weaker** than the `.app`'s explore-only, on purpose. The `.app` hides the
audit layer; a hosted build shows it, because the queue and the signed decisions are
the most interesting thing here. `/api/audit/preview` is the one POST that survives: it
reports what an edit *would* do and writes nothing, and it is what stops a wrong IRI
landing.

**Everything goes through the function, static files included.** Routing `web/` to
Vercel's static hosting would serve `app.js` and `audit.html` to anyone with the URL and
guard only the API. The auth check has to sit in front of everything or it guards
nothing.

**It fails closed.** With no `FOODON_PASSWORD` set, every request is refused. An auth
check that falls open when misconfigured is worse than none, because it looks like one.

```bash
vercel                                    # first deploy: creates the project
vercel env add FOODON_PASSWORD production # then set the password
vercel --prod                             # and redeploy with it
```

**Deploy from the CLI, not by connecting the repo.** `data/index.json` is 16 MB of
derived artefact and is gitignored, so a git-triggered build would go up with no index
and fail at import. `.vercelignore` exists to name those four runtime files back in —
Vercel falls back to `.gitignore` when it is absent, which is exactly the wrong
behaviour here.

Cold start is not a concern: `json.load` of the index is 0.06s and the whole `Resolver`
builds in 0.15s, so a cold invocation pays a sixth of a second. The bundle is 17 MB.

## Shipping it to someone without a checkout

`package/build_app.sh` produces `FoodOn Avoidance.app` and a drag-to-Applications
`.dmg` — 44 MB and 14 MB respectively. It exists so the tool can be handed to someone
who should not have to install Python, clone a private repo, or download a 40 MB
ontology to look at a graph.

```bash
brew install python@3.12 python-tk@3.12
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12 -m venv .buildenv
.buildenv/bin/pip install pyinstaller
package/build_app.sh
```

Freeze with Homebrew's Python, not `/usr/bin/python3`: Apple's is a Command Line Tools
stub and PyInstaller handles it badly.

The bundle carries only what the server opens at runtime — `data/index.json` and three
classified files, `config/`, `web/`. The vendor ontology and `robot.jar` are build-time
only, and leaving them out is 119 MB the app would otherwise carry for nothing. ROBOT
is reachable from the running app in exactly one place, the audit UI's *Rebuild*
button, and that interface is not in this build.

Three things about it are worth stating plainly, because each one is a limit somebody
will hit:

- **It is explore-only, enforced at the server.** `FOODON_EXPLORE_ONLY=1` makes every
  `/api/audit` route and the audit page itself return 403. The gate is in `serve.py`
  rather than a hidden link, because the audit page is reached by typing its URL and
  by nothing else — hiding a link that does not exist would protect nothing. The
  decision files ship read-only: an edit made on a copy with no review behind it is a
  decision nobody signed.
- **It is ad-hoc signed and therefore Gatekeeper-rejected.** `spctl` says `rejected`,
  and the recipient must approve it once under System Settings → Privacy & Security.
  `package/FIRST-RUN.md` walks through that. A Developer ID signature plus notarisation
  removes the step entirely and is the only thing that does.
- **It is arm64 only.** It will not launch on an Intel Mac. A universal build needs a
  universal Python to freeze against.

The launcher takes any free port rather than insisting on 8790, and shows a window with
a Quit button, because a local server with no window cannot be stopped by someone who
does not know what Activity Monitor is.

## Provenance and licence

Three bodies of work are stacked here and they are not under the same terms.

**FoodOn** is the ontology this is grounded in — 39,894 classes, release 2025-12-30,
declaring `https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/` in its own header. It is not
redistributed here: `.gitignore` keeps the vendor `.owl` out, and a clone fetches it
from `purl.obolibrary.org` against the committed `ontology/foodon.owl.sha256`. Cite it
as the OBO Foundry asks — Dooley et al., *FoodOn: a harmonized food ontology*, npj
Science of Food 2 (2018).

**ROBOT** (`ontodev/robot`, v1.9.10) does the merge, query and convert steps. Also not
redistributed; also hash-pinned; downloaded from its own GitHub release.

**Everything else in this repository** — the traversal, the patch layer, the audit
interface, the ingest pipeline, and every governed decision file under `config/` — is
this project's work. No licence has been chosen for it yet, which means all rights are
reserved and nobody else may reuse it; the repository is private while that is true.

One thing to be clear about, because it is the part most likely to be reused: the
decision files are **judgements, not data extracts**. `config/overrides.json` says
mayonnaise contains egg yolk; `config/ingredient-map.json` says a recipe line reading
`swordfish steaks` means `swordfish` and not `swordfish steak (raw)`. Those were
decided by a human reviewing a shortlist, one at a time, and they are only as good as
that review. They carry no warranty, and in particular **this is not a medical device
and not clinical advice** — a system that decides what a person with a food allergy
may eat needs review by someone qualified to take that responsibility, and nothing
here substitutes for it. The `Known limits` section above is the honest list of what
it does not catch.

The recipe corpora used to seed the ingredient map are not committed either; only the
term-to-class decisions derived from them are, and those name no recipe.
